title: "GLiDRE : Generalist model for Document-level Relation Extraction"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/GLiDRE
excerpt: 'This work adapts the GLiNER model for document-level relation extraction in French, as part of the TextMine 2025 challenge. Enhancements include pretraining on a subset of OSCAR dataset, local representations inspired by ATLOP, and optimized prediction thresholds. Results demonstrate modest performance but the model demonstrates potential in low-resource scenarios.'
